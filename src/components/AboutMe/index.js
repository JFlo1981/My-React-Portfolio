        <p>I am Jarod. A FullStack MERN web developer. I am nearing the end of the UT Austin Online Coding Boot Camp.
            During my time in the program I have developed skills in HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, NoSQL and MERN stack as well 
            as other helpful tools such as JQuery, Bootstrap, Insomnia and GraphQL.
            
            My goal is to continue building on the foundations set in the program to fulfill a career in web and app 
            development.</p>
